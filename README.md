Lawn Job is a game I wrote in 1983/84 timeframe 
when I was in my teenage years.  It is written in
C64 BASIC and was published in the October 1984
issue of "Ahoy!" magazine as a type-in game.  

See the text of the game play description directly 
from the magazine below.  I didn't change the last 
paragraph because I think it's funny.  Please
don't send a blank disk or, help me, a blank
cassette tape for me to make a copy for you.  I still
have the old equipment in storage, but there would
be a lot of dust and likely the smell of burning
electronics if I tried it.  I live far from there now
anyways.  I don't recall the count, but a LOT of
people did send those in, along with $3.
Not a bad gig for a kid.

The code is included as a .bas file.

Lawn Job is a game in which you play the
role of a lawn boy. As the game begins,
you are standing on the walkway in front
of your customer's house looking over the
task at hand. You must first start your mower by
pressing the fire button on the joystick plugged into
Control Port 2. As with the typical mower, it will
usually take several attempts to start. (Note: mower
will not move prior to starting.) After it starts you
can begin to mow the lawn.
As you mow, you must be cautious not to hit the
tree stumps or large rocks which are scattered about
the yard. Hitting these will cause your mower to
stop as well as cause excessive wear and tear to your
mower. You will want to avoid this as much as possible 
because the extra time spent restarting the
mower plus the added wear and tear can lessen your
final earnings considerably.
When your job is finished, you must maneuver
your mower to the customer's front porch and press
the fire button. This stops your mower and prompts
your customer to come out and examine your work.
You then must wait patiently while your work is
scrutinized. If your work is not finished. you will be
told so and you must restart the mower and finish
the job.
When the job is completed and the customer is
satisfied, your total earnings from the job will be
calculated. The amount of time you took (gas monoey)
plus fifty cents for each rock or tree stump that
you hit (wear and tear) will be subtracted from your
base score in order to determine the total amount of
money that you earned for the job.
If you would rather not type in this program and
don't want to spring for our monthly disk (see page

tape, a self-addressed stamped mailer, and $3 to:
